## Latest

### Added

- Added new environment variable `URL_REWRITE_MAPPING` to allow rewriting of URLs to support the check of
  key-attestation
- Added `key_attestations` to `CredentialInfoResponseDto.java` to support key attestations in the deferred
  credential flow.
  the credential request.
- Expanded the credential endpoint to accept the new credential-endpoint (with corresponding response)
  defined [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-credential-endpoint),
  and the deferred credential endpoint which is
  defined [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-deferred-credential-endpoin).
  These endpoints can be used by setting the custom header `SWIYU-API-Version=2`. These endpoints are not yet pentested.
- Expanded cnf to contain correct structure while still providing the old one. Example:

```json
{
    "cnf": {
        "kty": "EC",
        "crv": "P-256",
        "x": "...",
        "y": "...",
        "jwk": {
            "kty": "EC",
            "crv": "P-256",
            "x": "...",
            "y": "..."
        }
    }
}
```

- Breaking! Refactored the getCredentialOffer endpoint which now returns all the credential offer information (but not
  the offer data, which is not needed)
    - Deprecated the getCredentialOfferDeeplink endpoint, which is now replaced by the getCredentialOffer endpoint (as
      it delivers the same information)
    - Added new endpoint patch `/management/api/credentials{credentialId}` which updates / creates the credential offer
      for a deferred endpoint.
    - Added a new ClientAgentInfoDto which are used for the deferred credential flow. This is stored in the database
      (db migration is necessary & included)
- Breaking! updated url path to distinguish management (with `/management`) and oid4vci (with `/oid4vci`) urls
- Added new endpoint `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` that provides the same information as the
  `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint but in a OAuth2-centric way.
- The `/.well-known/openid-configuration` still exists and is not deprecated.

- Added new endpoints for
  optional
  OID4VCI [deferred flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html#name-deferred-credential-endpoin)
    - Changed the `/credential` to check if the request is marked as deferred in
      the `credentialMetadata` with `"deferred: true"`, which is set by the issuer-agent-management. The endpoint
      returns a transaction_id
      instead of a credential.
    - Added `/oid4vci/deferred-credential-request` to request deferred credential with the received transaction id
    - Added Documentation in the issuer-agent-management repository.
    - Added new credential request errors that are necessary for the deferred flow: ISSUANCE_PENDING,
      INVALID_TRANSACTION_ID

Example response of the credential endpoint `/credential` ("deferred: true") is:

```json
{
    "transaction_id": "b932ca39-0158-4a31-80e4-8aa15d9d987c",
    "c_nonce": "5585f3ba-e41f-4556-8182-bb148eb8c344"
}
```

Example payload of the request to deferred-credential endpoint`/deferred_credential` is:

```json
{
    "transaction_id": "b932ca39-0158-4a31-80e4-8aa15d9d987c",
    "proof": {
        "proof_type": "jwt",
        "jwt": "..."
    }
}
```

- Enable requesting Key Attestation via Issuer Metadata. This can be used with key_attestation_required. See readme for
  more details.
- Enable receiving and verification of Key Attestations in Credential Request Proofs. Verifying the integrity of the
  attestation and checking if it was issued by one of the issuers trusted in TRUSTED_ATTESTATION_PROVIDERS.
- Fixed incorrect error code when access token is wrong to INVALID_TOKEN instead of INVALID_CREDENTIAL.
- Expanded `/token` functionality. The endpoint accepts now `application/x-www-urlencoded` and no content-type.
  It still accepts the values in the url as request-params (this functionality will be removed in the future) and
  as `x-www-form-urlencoded` body.
- Credential Offer is now validated according to the published metadata. Additional 'surprise' claims are no longer
  supported.
- Optional OAuth security with bearer tokens on `/management` endpoints.
  It can be activated and configured via spring environment variables.

### Fixed

- Checks for protected claims are now done in the create-offer-flow (1 step) instead of the issuance flow.
- Business Issuer is directly informed when the payload cannot be processed later.
- Fix status code when jwt filter criteria are not met from a 500 to 401.
- Fixed error code when deferred endpoint is called with invalid transaction id to INVALID_TRANSACTION_ID instead of
  INVALID_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST.

## 1.0.0

Merge of issuer-agent-management 1.6.1 and issuer-agent-oid4vci into one service.

For migration merge environment variables. Please ensure that management endpoints are not accessible from public using
a WAF or Reverse-Proxy limiting the reachable endpoints.

Note: If using HSM for signing, both status list and credentials must be signed with HSM.
