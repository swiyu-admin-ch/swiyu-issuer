# Warning - This Version is work in progress and NOT PEN-TESTED

# Generic issuer service

This software is a web server implementing the technical standards as specified in
the [Swiss e-ID and trust infrastructure: Initial implementation](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/initial-technology/).
Together with the other generic components provided, this software forms a collection of APIs allowing issuance and
verification of verifiable credentials without the need of reimplementing the standards.

The Generic Issuer Service is the interface to offer a credential. It should be only accessible from the
issuers internal organization.

As with all the generic issuance & verification services it is expected that every issuer and verifier hosts their own
instance of the service.

A possible deployment configuration of the issuer service. Issuer Business System as well as API

# Deployment

> Please make sure that you did the following before starting the deployment:
>
> - Generated the signing keys file with the didtoolbox.jar
> - Generated a DID which is registered on the identifier registry
> - Registered yourself on the swiyuprobeta portal
> - Registered yourself on the api self service portal

> Are you a third-party user? Then you're right here! Otherwhise go to [gov internal usage](#Gov-internal-usage)

## 1. Set the environment variables

A sample compose file for an entire setup of both components and a database can be found
in [sample.compose.yml](sample.compose.yml) file.
**Replace all placeholder <VARIABLE_NAME>**.

Please be aware that both the swiyu-issuer-service needs to be publicly accessible over a domain configured
in `EXTERNAL_URL`
so that a wallet can communicate with them.

## 2. Create a verifiable credentials schema

In order to support your use case you need to adapt the so-called issuer_metadata (
see [sample.compose.yml](sample.compose.yml#L85)).
Those metadata define the appearance of the credential in the wallet and what kind of credential formats are supported.
For further information consult the [Cookbooks](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/cookbooks/)

## 3. Initialize the status list

Once the swiyu-issuer-service and postgres instance are up and running you need to initialize the status
list of your issuer so that you can issue credentials with a status.

It is possible to issue credentials without status. Be wary though, as these credentials can not be revoked anymore!

**Request to create an status list slot**  
The url you'll receive in the response will be used in the next request as STATUS_JWT_URL

```bash
curl -X POST https://<SWIYU_STATUS_REGISTRY_API_URL>/api/v1/status/business-entities/<SWIYU_PARTNER_ID>/status-list-entries/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <SWIYU_STATUS_REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -d '{}'


```

The following request needs to be run on your swiyu-issuer-service instance.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<EXTERNAL_URL of swiyu-issuer-service>/status-list \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "uri": "<STATUS_JWT_URL>",
    "type": "TOKEN_STATUS_LIST",
    "maxLength": 100000,
    "config": {
    "bits": 2
    }
  }'

```

## 4. Issue credential

You're now ready to issue credentials by using the swiyu-issuer-service API which is accessible under
https://<EXTERNAL_URL of swiyu-issuer-service>**/swagger-ui/index.html#/Credential%20API/createCredential** to create
a credential offer for a holder. Here is an example of a request body for the offer creation

```json
{
    "metadata_credential_supported_id": [
        "myIssuerMetadataCredentialSupportedId"
    ],
    "credential_subject_data": {
        "lastName": "Example",
        "firstName": "Edward"
    },
    "offer_validity_seconds": 86400,
    "credential_valid_until": "2030-01-01T19:23:24Z",
    "credential_valid_from": "2010-01-01T18:23:24Z",
    "status_lists": [
        "https://example-status-registry-uri/api/v1/statuslist/05d2e09f-21dc-4699-878f-89a8a2222c67.jwt"
    ]
}
```

### VCT - verifiable credential type

A verifiable credential in the sd-jwt vc format has a vct claim. The content of this is set through the issuer metadata
for each credential configuration supported entry. The vct can be a string or URL. If it is a URL it should be
resolveable to SD-JWT VC Type Metadata.
When providing a URL, it is recommended to use a subresource
integrity [sri](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) hash.
The integrity hash is provided with each created credential offer in the offer metadata while issuing the credential.
The integrity can be calculated using shell commands.

`echo "sha256-$(wget -O- http://localhost:8080/oid4vci/vct/my-vct-v01 | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 | openssl base64 -A)"`

```json
{
    "metadata_credential_supported_id": [
        "myIssuerMetadataCredentialSupportedId"
    ],
    "credential_subject_data": {
        "lastName": "Example",
        "firstName": "Edward"
    },
    "offer_validity_seconds": 86400,
    "credential_valid_until": "2030-01-01T19:23:24Z",
    "credential_valid_from": "2010-01-01T18:23:24Z",
    "status_lists": [
        "https://example-status-registry-uri/api/v1/statuslist/05d2e09f-21dc-4699-878f-89a8a2222c67.jwt"
    ],
    "credential_metadata": {
        "vct#integrity": "sha256-JXU3403niPeAUi8FN0IX6wfXafrgusykHC1LpKMOO94="
    }
}
```

More details on the vct claim can be found in
the [swiss profile](https://github.com/e-id-admin/open-source-community/blob/main/tech-roadmap/swiss-profile.md#sd-jwt-vc)
and the latest version
of [SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/). For
compatibility with other ecosystem participants, please use the adoptions as shown in the swiss profile.

### Deployment considerations

Please note that by default configuration the issuer service is set up in a way to easily gain experience with the
issuance process,
not as a productive deployment. With the configurations found bellow, it can be configured and set up for productive
use.

We recommend to not expose the service directly to the web. The focus of the application lies in the functionality of
the issuance.
Using API Gateway or Web Application Firewall can decrease the attack surface significantly.

To prevent misuse, the management endpoints should be protected by either by network infrastructure (for example mTLS)
or using OAuth.

# Development

> Please be aware that this section **focus on the development of the issuer agent service**. For the deployment of
> the
> component please consult [deployment section](#Deployment).

## Setup

- Start application IssuerApplication with local profile

    - Starts docker compose for database
    - Runs Flyway migrations if needed

### Updating Openapi Spec

The `openapi.yaml` can be updated by using the generate-doc profile.

```
mvn verify -P generate-doc
```

## Configuration

If you start the application with the local profile as described below, you need to set the credentials for the
status-list api-gateway api in the `application-local.yml` file. The credentials can be obtained from the swiyu
portal. The following properties need to be set:

1. If you have a client key and secret you have to set the following properties in the `application-local.yml` file:

```yaml
swiyu:
    status-registry:
    customer-key: "customer-key"
    customer-secret: "customer-secret"
```

2. If you have a refresh token you have to set the following properties in the `application-local.yml`

```yaml
swiyu:
    status-registry:
        api-url: "https://api-url"
        enable-refresh-token-flow: true
        bootstrap-refresh-token: "your refresh token"
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The values can also be set as environment variables. For more information check
> the [Configuration Environment Variables](#configuration-environment-variables) section.

To start the application locally you can run:

```shell
mvn -f issuer-application  spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

Note: This spins up a local PostgreSQL database via docker. Once running, Openapi-Documentation can be
accessed [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/).

### Generate Keys

Currently only EC 256 keys are used.
Generate private key with:
`openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ec_private.pem`
Remember to keep private keys private and safe. It should never be transmitted, etc.

On the base registry the public key is published. To generate the public key form the private key we can use
`openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out ec_public.pem`

#### JWT Based Data Integrity

If there is the need to further protect the API / Data Integrity it is possible to enable the feature with a flag and
set the environment variables with the allowed public key as a JSON Web Key Set

| Variable                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| ENABLE_JWT_AUTH           | Enables the requirement of writing calls to the issuer agent to be signed JWT                                                                                                                                                   |
| JWKS_ALLOWLIST (Optional) | When ENABLE_JWT_AUTH is set to true with this property the public keys authorized to perform a writing call can be set as a Json Web Key set according to [RFC7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#appendix-A.1) |

```
    ENABLE_JWT_AUTH=true
    JWKS_ALLOWLIST={"keys":[{"kty":"EC","crv":"P-256","kid":"testkey","x":"_gHQsZT-CB_KvIfpvJsDxVSXkuwRJsuof-oMihcupQU","y":"71y_zEPAglUXBghaBxypTAzlNx57KNY9lv8LTbPkmZA"}]}
```

If the JWT based authentication is activated it's expected to all in calls be wrapped in a signed JWT with the claim "
data".
The value of the data claim will contain the full json body of the normal request.

Note that this is only affects writing calls.

#### Data Integrity Check

To provide a data integrity check with the issuer it is possible to provide the credential subject data as JWT.

See [CredentialOfferCreateJWTIT.java](src/test/java/ch/admin/bj/swiyu/issuer/management/it/CredentialOfferCreateJwtIT.java)
for examples on how to use.

| secret.swiyu.status-registry.bootstrap-refresh-token | The customer refresh token to bootstrap the auth flow for for requests to the status registry api. This is provided by the api self managment portal. |

#### HSM - Hardware Security Module

For operations with an HSM, the keys need not be mounted directly into the environment running this application.
Instead, a connection is created to the HSM via JCA. This can be with
the [Sun PKCS11 provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/security/pkcs11-reference-guide1.html) or a vendor
specific option.
Note that for creating the keys it is expected that the public key is provided as self-signed certificated.

For vendor specific options it is necessary to provide the library in the java classpath. For this mount or add the
necessary jars to the docker container.
Provide the environment variable `JAVA_BOOTCLASSPATH` to the directory which should be added to the classpath.

### Config Files

Config Files can be mounted in the container. For further details please refer to the cookbooks.

#### Config File Templating

The content of the metadata json files, among these METADATA_CONFIG_FILE and OPENID_CONFIG_FILE can be annotated with
template values.
By default, the external-url can be always used.

```
{
  "issuer": "${external-url}",
  "token_endpoint": "${external-url}/oid4vci/token"
}
```

Using Spring environment variables arbitrary environment variables can be used for the templating.

Let's say we want to add a prefix to the display name for your VC depending on the environment your issuer runs on.
This can be achieved by adding in a template value, which is in essence an arbitrary string decorated by ${}.
In this case we choose "stage". The environment variables are all in caps.
See
the [official Spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.6.1/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables)
for further information.

```
...
      "display": [
        {
          "name": "${stage}MyCredential",
...
```

In our deployment we can set the value by adding in the environment variable
`APPLICATION_TEMPLATEREPLACEMENT_STAGE=dev-`

#### Allowed Issuer Metadata config values

The configuration `proof_types_supported` allows specifying the required security specification the wallet should store
key material in for the credential. This value is provided alongside `proof_signing_alg_values_supported`.
Use of `key_attestation_required` is optional.

Example value

```
"proof_types_supported": {
        "jwt": {
          "proof_signing_alg_values_supported": [
            "ES256"
          ],
          "key_attestations_required": {
            "key_storage": ["iso_18045_high"]
          }
        }
      }
```

The value of `key_attestation_required` can be an empty json object `{}`. This requests a key attestation to provided,
but leaves the choice of security level up to the wallet.
A key attestation is proof created by a service (henceforth called attestation service) attesting the wallets key has
been created according to a given security standard.
We as issuer have to trust this attestation service. For more details about key attestations refer to the OID4VCI
specification
or other online resources like for example
the [android documentation](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-key-attestation).

| Supported key_storage Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| iso_18045_enhanced-basic	   | Key storage is resistant to attack with attack potential "Enhanced-Basic", equivalent to VAN.3 according to ISO 18045. This is the case if TEE is used.                                                                                                |
| iso_18045_high              | Key storage is is resistant to attack with attack potential "High", equivalent to VAN.5 according to ISO 18045. This is the case if Strongbox/Secure enclave is used. Please note that no backup of credentials issued with this security can be made. |

It is possible to limit key attestation providers by their DID. This can be configured with providing a list of trusted
attestation issuers.
If an empty array is provided (default) the key attestation is trusted from any issuer.
The attestations integrity and signature are checked in every case.

| Variable                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | Default |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| TRUSTED_ATTESTATION_PROVIDERS | This array of strings contains dids (used in JWT "iss" claim) to be trusted for the key attestation. Is only used if key attestations are demanded for the credential issued. | []      |

#### VC Metadata provisioning

In some simpler deployments no content delivery network is available to provide credential metadata for things like
vct (verifiable credential type), json schemas or overlays capture architecture. In this case the desired files can be
mounted in similar fashion to the issuer metadata.
A significant difference is though that the file locations are specified ad-hoc with spring environment variables as
documented in [Config File Templating](#config-file-templating)

Placeholders in these files will be replaced as well.

| Variable Map                                          | Destination                |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| APPLICATION_VCTMETADATAFILES_                         | $EXTERNAL_URL/vct/         |
| APPLICATION_JSONSCHEMAMETADATAFILES_                  | $EXTERNAL_URL/json-schema/ |
| APPLICATION_OVERLAYSCAPTUREARCHITECTUREMETADATAFILES_ | $EXTERNAL_URL/oca/         |

For example we could use the file `/cfg-files/vct-test.json` by setting
`APPLICATION_VCTMETADATAFILES_TESTV1=file:/cfg-files/vct-test.json`.
The content of vct-test.json will then be available at `$EXTERNAL_URL/vct/testv1`

#### Webhook Callbacks

For issuers it can be useful to have up-to-date information about offered credentials.
It is possible to configure a Webhook Callback endpoint, optionally secured by API Key. Please note that delivery of
callback events will be retried until successful, to guarantee an at-least-once delivery.
Failed deliveries will create error logs and be retried in the next interval.

| Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WEBHOOK_CALLBACK_URI   | Full URI of the REST endpoint where webhooks shall be sent to. No Callback events will be created if not set.                                                                         |
| WEBHOOK_API_KEY_HEADER | (Optional) API key header, if the callback uri has a api key for protection. Will be used as HTTP header key.                                                                         |
| WEBHOOK_API_KEY_VALUE  | (Optional, Required if WEBHOOK_API_KEY_HEADER is set) The API key used.                                                                                                               |
| WEBHOOK_INTERVAL       | How often the collected events are sent. Value interpreted as millisends if given a plain integer or an [ISO 8601 duration format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations). | 

Callbacks will be sent on change of VC state, such as when the VC is issued to a holder or is deferred.
Errors which concern the issuing process also create callbacks.

        uuid status_id PK, FK
        integer index
    }

    STATUS_LIST {
        uuid id PK

        jsonb config
        text uri
        text status_zipped

    }

    CREDENTIAL_OFFER one to many CREDENTIAL_OFFER_STATUS: "has status"
    STATUS_LIST one to many CREDENTIAL_OFFER_STATUS: "is referenced in"
```

Note: Status List info comes from config and are populated to the DB the first time a Credential uses the status.
ID of the credential offer is also the id used by the issuer adapter (the component communicating with the issuer agent)
to revoke the credential. It is returned when a new offer is created. It's recommended to save this id to
revoke the credential later on.

## Credential flows

    end
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you use the deferred flow, you need to set the `deferred: true` in the `credentialMetadata` of the credential offer
> request.

The credential offer data is not required when the deferred flow is used. It can be set on a later point in time with
the `patch /management/api/credentials/{credentialId}` endpoint. This endpoint also changes the status from `DEFERRED`
to `READY`.

## SWIYU

### Status registry

To use the swiyu status registry to host your status lists you need a registration via ePortal to the swiyu ecosystem.
To get the appropriate credentials please visit the swiyu portal application on ePortal.

For access to the swiyu api you need a refresh token along with your other credentials, please see the `SWIYU_*`
environment variables for further details.

The refresh token can only be used one time, but dont worry: the application does manage the refresh tokens itself.  
But if your issuer agent component does not run for over a week it might be possible that the refresh token
saved in the database is no longer valid and cannot be used to start the api auth flow.  
If this is the case you need to manually create a new refresh token in the api self service portal and bootstrap your
issuer agent managment component with this token.  
The application does log an appropriate error if it detects such an issue but will still start up.  
Updates to the status registry will fail as long as the auth flow is not restarted with a valid bootstrap token.

### Latest development

The current default implementation of the issuer agent management component is based on
the [OID4VCI specs DRAFT 13](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-ID1.html).
But there are already some features from
the [OID4VCI specs DRAFT 16](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) implemented for
example the:

* new credential-endpoint (with corresponding response)
  defined [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-credential-endpoint)
* new deferred credential endpoint
  defined [here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html#name-deferred-credential-endpoin)

These endpoints can be used if the custom header `SWIYU-API-Version=2` is set in the request. These endpoints are not
yet pentested.

#### Setup a local environment

9. Use Customer Key & Secret to configure application-local.yml
10. Onboard via API Gateway (TODO)

## Missing Features and Known Issues

The swiyu Public Beta Trust Infrastructure was deliberately released at an early stage to enable future ecosystem
participants. The [feature roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/swiyu-admin-ch/projects/1/views/7) shows the current
discrepancies between Public Beta and the targeted productive Trust Infrastructure. There may still be minor bugs or
security vulnerabilities in the test system. These are marked as [‘KnownIssues’](../../issues) in each repository.

## Contributions and feedback

The code for this repository is developed privately and will be released after each sprint. The published code can
therefore only be a snapshot of the current development and not a thoroughly tested version. However, we welcome any
feedback on the code regarding both the implementation and security aspects. Please follow the guidelines for
contributing found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
